# Generative Music Machines

In this talk/workshop we will learn and utilise creative coding tools to create bespoke interfaces that combine generative visuals with sound generation and control. We will be working with the creative coding language [Processing](https://processing.org/) and will start off by learning how to create basic generative visuals before expanding these to connect as control signals for audio software and other external platforms.
